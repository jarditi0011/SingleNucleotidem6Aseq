# SingleNucleotidem6Aseq
This repository contains R scripts used for analysis of single-nucleotide-resolution m6A sequence data, including preprocessing, calculating transcript entropy, extracting annotation information from GTF, running statistical tests, determining gene ontologies and generating unique graphics. 
It was created to partially fulfill the requirements to obtain the degree Bachelor of Science with Honors in Computational Biology from the Center for Computational Molecular Biology at Brown University.
